Hey Folks!We Build this SORTING VISUALIZER as we had very keen intrest in how all 
these sorting algorithm really works?
So as being a developer we develop our own project of sorting algorithm for resolving our queries of mind.
And now we started playing around with our own visualizer and used it to get better understand the sorting.
If you are also unable to visualize how they work.Just use our Sorting Visualizer so that you understand about these algorithms in more better
and visual way.
We hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool and also if you don't then just go clear your basics lol.
